# Simple International Keyboard

Forked from https://github.com/rkkr/simple-keyboard which is forked

Many people in Europe speak multiple languages. Instead of switching between several keyboard layouts they often prefer to use the English keyboard layout and forgo their national specific accented letters. The result is anything but nice. Some words written without accents have different meaning in some languages, and the overall appearance of the text is sloppy.

Android default English layout offers some accented letters, but not all, and not the ones that are most needed.

For example: in the Hungarian language "Å±" (latin small letter u with double acute) is a distinct letter of the alphabet. We cannot replace it with "u" or any other variant of "u", just like you cannot write "a", instead of "z" in your language.

I have already defined similar keyboard layouts for Windows and Linux, and have been using them for a long time. My goal is to have the same for Android, and extend it to support all major languages that use the Latin alphabet.

All layouts are based on the classic English QWERTY layout. Only the additional letters, those that are accesssible after long press of the main letter, are different.

Contributions, suggestions and translations are wellcome, as long as they do not increase complexity and do not change the base layout.
